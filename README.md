# BioPixel: Investigating Bio-compatibile Materials for Wearable Eink Display Fabrication

BioPixel explores the development of a wearable E-Ink display using biocompatible E-Ink microcapsules
embedded in a conductive hydrogel substrate. This project builds on home-made E-Ink microcapsules
developed in Bristol. While these capsules are functional, they are still in the early stages of development,
and it remains unclear how to embed them into materials suitable for wearable displays. As such, the
project is rooted in chemistry, biology, and materials science to explore the potential integration of these
microcapsules into functional wearable systems.
We appraise technical literature to consolidate foundational knowledge across biocompatibility testing,
hydrogel design and electrophoretic display integration. We develop a conductive hydrogel that can be
used in wearable electronic displays. We identify a key roadblock to the creation of a wearable E-Ink
display, the fragility and poor UV stability of the current generation of biocompatible E-Ink microcapsules,
and propose future development strategies to overcome these limitations. By addressing the gap between
recent advances in biocompatible electrophoretic materials, flexible conductive materials, and the vision
of a wearable E-Ink display we lay the foundation for the future realisation of a wearable E-Ink display
and, ultimately, ”digital tattoos”.
